 - Define serialization 
 x- Stream read/write Byte and Bits (for bit stream see 114)
 - Inlining
 - Linking by Ids (covered next ch, see p123 dealing with missing objects is not clear)
 - Compression
 -- Sparse Array compression (e.g. null terminating string)
 o-- Entropy Encoding - 'based on how unexpected it is' e.g. vector z usually 0.  Also Huffman.  See p127
 x-- Fixed Point - float compression by considering min, max, and precision to convert to ushort (ish).
 --- Geometry - Quaternion from 128 bits to 49 bits (convert xyz to ushort, calc w) (and Matrix)
 x- Serialize
